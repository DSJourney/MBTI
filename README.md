MBTI (In progress)
==============================

In this project I go over the MBTI dataset in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type) created by Mitchell J.

My goal is to analyze this dataset and see if a classification model can determine each MBTI type just by looking at the person's posts in the forum Personality Cafe.

The process followed is:
1. Problem Identification – this step involves identifying the correct problem to solve and setting goals for your project
1. Data Wrangling – this step involves the collection, organization, and definition of a dataset or datasets
1. Exploratory Data Analysis – this step involves creating plots and charts to understand the relationship between data and the features of that data
1. Pre-processing and Training Data Development – this step involves standardizing and training your dataset
1. Modeling – this involves selecting, training and deploying a model to make predictive insights
1. Documentation – this involves documenting the work you’ve done and sharing your findings
