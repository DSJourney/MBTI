MBTI Classification (In progress)
==============================

In this project I go over the MBTI dataset in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type) created by Mitchell J.

My goal is to analyze this dataset and see if a classification model can determine each MBTI type just by looking at the person's posts in the Personality Cafe forum.

The process followed is:
* **Problem Identification** – this step involves identifying the correct problem to solve and setting goals for your project. [PDF](https://github.com/DSJourney/MBTI/blob/master/reports/0.%20Problem%20Identification/Problem%20Identification%20-%20MBTI.pdf)

* **Data Wrangling** – this step involves the collection, organization, and definition of a dataset or datasets. [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DSJourney/MBTI/blob/master/notebooks/Data%20Wrangling/MBTI_Data_Wrangling.ipynb)

* **Exploratory Data Analysis** – this step involves creating plots and charts to understand the relationship between data and the features of that data. [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DSJourney/MBTI/blob/master/notebooks/EDA/MBTI_EDA_Clean.ipynb#visuals)

* **Feature Engineering & Pre-processing** – this step involves standardizing the dataset and creating features. For the time being, I have also added some NLP models in this notebook. 

* **Modeling** – this involves selecting, training and deploying a model to make predictive insights. PENDING

* **Documentation** – this involves documenting the work you’ve done and sharing your findings. PENDING
